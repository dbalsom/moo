# moo_util

A general-purpose utility for working with MOO files.

This utility is still under active development, features are subject to change at any time.

moo_util is designed around several "command verbs", one of which should be the first command line argument provided.

- `check`: Check a MOO file or directory of MOO files for errors
- `find`: Find a specific test by its hexadecimal hash string
- `display`: Display a specific test by its hexadecimal hash string or index, in human-readable format

moo_util has help available with `-h`, and for each command with `[command] -h`
